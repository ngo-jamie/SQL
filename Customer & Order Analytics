AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = 'iPhone'
AND length(orderID) = 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT cust.acctnum), AVG(quantity)*price
